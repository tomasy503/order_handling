# Laser-Cutting Order Assignment Optimization

## 1. Core Problem
Twenty producers are required to handle 50 laser-cutting orders per day. Every producer has unique capacities, target volumes, machine dimension restrictions, and varying acceptance rates. The value, size, and processing needs of each order vary. The objective is to maximise accepted orders and overall efficiency by effectively matching each order to an appropriate producer in a single daily batch run. Assuring compatibility, reaching target quantities, aiming for the highest total value, and managing rejections brought on by stochastic acceptance. It needs to be considered that designing a system that discovers the best assignment, makes the best use of the producer network, and adjusts to uncertainty in the real world can become a challange.

## 2. Thoughts and Considerations
- **Understand Constraints**: Ensure each order fits a producer’s capabilities and size limits.
- **Objective Setting**: Aim to maximize accepted orders, overall value, and minimize transportation costs.
- **Stochastic Acceptance**: Integrate uncertainty by simulating acceptance, possibly using predicted probabilities from historical data.
- **Balancing Workloads**: Assign more orders to producers behind their volume targets.
- **Iterative Optimization**: Use integer programming or heuristic methods, run multiple iterations with shuffled data or perturbed acceptance rates to escape local optima.
- **Quality Metrics**: Measure success by acceptance rate, net benefit, balance of workloads, and reduction in reassignments.

**Limitations** include uncertainty in acceptance rates, potential model complexity, and data quality issues. Ensuring the model’s adaptability, robustness, and interpretability is crucial.

## 3. Next Steps Toward Production and Data Science Integration
- **Data Pipeline**: Automate the preprocessing, cleansing, and gathering of data.
- **Predictive Modelling**: Create machine learning models that forecast acceptance rates by using context and past data.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Use model versioning, CI/CD pipelines, and performance monitoring in conjunction with MLOps principles. To monitor KPIs, acceptance rates, volumes, and transportation expenses, create dashboards using analytics and visualisation.
- **Scalability and Integration**: Integrate with current order management systems by containerising the solution (Docker) and deploying it on cloud infrastructure.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Use sophisticated optimisation algorithms or reinforcement learning to improve decision-making and adapt in real-time.
